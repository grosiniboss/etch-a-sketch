"# etch-a-sketch"  https://grosiniboss.github.io/etch-a-sketch/

My take on The Odin Project's "Etch a sketch" Foundations project. This one was mostly done to further exercise DOM insertion and to... force flexbox to act like CSS Grid - it was one of the project requirements.
The boxes should also properly flex now, as opposed to my previous flexbox project.
